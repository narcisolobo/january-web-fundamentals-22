APIS - What are they even?
Application Programming Interface

An API is like a mediator between the user (client) and the resource.
Like a waiter between you, the diner and the kitchen.

REST - Representational State Transfer
RESTful API's adhere to the REST architectural standards.

If I, the user, make an API call to get the weather, I get back a response. For instance, I may get back two values, a high temp and a low temp.

The response could be in one of several different formats. The most popular is JSON. JavaScript Object Notation.

A RESTful API consists of resources that are accessed by one or more endpoints.
